### Introduction

Hi everyone!,

I don't know how to do this without repeating what I wrote on the [about][about.markdown] section, but anyway, I need to start somewhere.

**So... here we go!! :D**

Hi!, my name is Sergio, I'm 28 years old and, currently, I'm a Quality Assurance Engineer working for Amazon in Dublin.

To give you a little bit of a bullet-point, quick, **background story**: I...
 - was born in Madrid, Spain
 - grew up and lived there until 2018
 - loved technology from a very young age, one of my highlights being putting cookies inside the VHS player because, well, I wanted to watch some cookie shows (?).
 - learned music too!, inspired from my father and his family (most of them are musicians or are related to music somehow), I ended up getting a profesional degree in clarinet. Although I must confess I don't play it that much anymore.
 - studied a double degree of Computer Science and Software Science
 - worked 3 years as an Automation Engineer in a mid-size company in Madrid
 - applied for a QAE position for Alexa International in Amazon Dublin
 - the interview went well apparently
 - and here I am 3 years later!

I see this blog as an opportunity for me to broaden my future, grow as an engineer, and more importantly, share it with any person that may be taking a similar path.  

But what path? why are you writing a blog now?

I'll give better, longer explanations soon, but, to give a quick answer: In this blog I will describe the steps I take, the projects I make, the things I learn in my path moving from a QAE position to a SW Engineer position.

I hope to see you around :)
