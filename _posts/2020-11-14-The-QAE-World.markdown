### Motivation

I see the QAE world as a **three dimensional field**, or like a triangle.

On one of the corners, you'll see the "purest" QAE side of the role, which is also the most "manager-like" of the three: 
 - Feature analysis
 - Test strategy
 - Test planning
 - Reporting
 - Sign offs
 - Issue tracking
 - And so on

On the second corner, you'll have the execution side:
- Manual execution
- Automated execution
- Issue reporting
- Results analysis
- A bit of troubleshooting (enough to raise the issue)
