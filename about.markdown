Hi!, my name is Sergio and I'm a QAE (Quality Assurance Engineer) currently working for Amazon!.

After 5+ years of experience on this side of the software development cycle (from test strategy definition and test planning to test automation with JS, Java, Groovy, C# and Python frameworks), I've decided to try to broaden my horizons by moving to a Software Engineer role!

The path ahead is challenging but exciting and I plan on keeping track of it here, in this blog :).

I guess it will be my tech journal from now on.

See you around!.

S.
